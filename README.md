# Building-with-Polygon-Bridge

## Description
This project illustrates execution of an organization's need to move an NFT project from Ethereum to Polygon to increase demand and save on gas.

It features deployment of an NFT collection on the Ethereum blockchain, which is then mapped to Polygon, and corresponding assets transferred over via the Polygon Bridge. To put a twist to the project, the image generation tool - lexica was used to create the images for each NFT in the collection. These images were stored on IPFS using pinata.cloud and the NFT contract includes a "promptDescription" function, which when called, returns the prompt used to generate the respective image for an NFT.

The project includes a hardhat script to batch mint all NFTs (employing the ERC721A standard) and to batch transfer all NFTs from Ethereum to Polygon Mumbai using the FxPortal Bridge specifically. It first approves the NFTs to be transferred, deposits them to the Bridge, and then tests the "balanceOf" on Mumbai when state sync has happened.

## Getting Started
### Installing

* Clone this repository to get an exact copy of this program on your computer by running thee following command.
```
git clone https://github.com/Adesdesk/Building-with-Polygon-Bridge.git
```

* Navigate into the repository folder in your preferred command line interface. Using the terminal in VSCode is a good option.

### Executing program

* Ensure that the terminal now points to the Building-with-Polygon-Bridge folder, then run the following command.
```
yarn install
```
* create a new file named ".env" (quotes not included) and specify each environment variable, naming them just as used throughout the scripts.

* When completed, run the commands below in the same order so as to execute the corresponding scripts accordingly

* Running the "testBalanceOf.js" script as in the 4th command below should be delayed until about 30 minutes after successfully running the "batchTransfer.js" script so as to allow state sync acrross the chains.
```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network goerli
npx hardhat run scripts/batchMint.js --network goerli
npx hardhat run scripts/batchTransfer.js --network goerli
npx hardhat run scripts/testBalanceOf.js --network mumbai
```

## Help

* You need to have NodeJS installed to your computer in order to run this program locally.

* Ensure to name your environment variables as used in the scripts or you would need to rename those in the scripts to match your own naming preference.
